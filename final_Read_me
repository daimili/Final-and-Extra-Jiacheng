Things do not to do:
1.Please run rake db:seed just one time, otherwise it will add some repetitive entries into database.
we put some data already in database, and there is not much that db:seed will do.

2.Also please use Chrome browser instead of others, due to that other may not support CSS we added. 

3.Don't recreate whole table again, because our group have loaded many data into database for your convenience.


Things we have done:

1.password chaning notification email and new user welcome email
2.using some coffeescript in user.js.coffee and in the show view of users
3.user could add comment to a specific pin,f ollow other users, have their board and put pins in the board, also
